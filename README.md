## 📌 Project Overview

**MedSmile** is an on-premise healthcare satisfaction analytics system that unifies patient surveys, hospital ratings, and operational data into a centralized **PostgreSQL data warehouse**. Using **Talend** for ETL and **Power BI** for visualization, the system provides healthcare administrators with actionable insights into patient experience, facility performance, and operational efficiency.

## ❗ Problem Definition

Healthcare organizations often manage fragmented data across multiple systems: patient satisfaction surveys, facility ratings, contact and location details, and emergency service metrics. This fragmentation prevents:

- Holistic analysis of patient experience  
- Cross-facility performance comparisons  
- Identification of underperforming services  
- Data-driven, transparent decision-making  

**MedSmile** addresses these challenges through a centralized, on-premise data warehouse that consolidates healthcare data into a single analytical platform.

---

## 🏥 Business Context

MedSmile supports four core business functions:

### 1. Hospital Operations
- Centralized facility information  
- Supports staffing optimization, capacity planning, and service delivery decisions  

### 2. Patient Management
- Aggregated survey data for quality monitoring  
- Enables tracking of patient satisfaction and potential readmissions  

### 3. Patient Engagement
- Structured feedback collection  
- Enables targeted improvements in communication and service quality  

### 4. Regulatory Reporting
- Unified data infrastructure for consistent and auditable reporting  
- Facilitates compliance with healthcare policies and stakeholder requirements  

An **on-premise PostgreSQL deployment** supports strict data governance and healthcare compliance needs.

## 🗂 Data Model

### Source Data

The system integrates five primary data sources:

1. `Hospital_Details`  
2. `Location`  
3. `Patient_Details`  
4. `Survey_Details`  
5. `Emergency_Services`  

Data is sourced from the  
**[US Hospital Customer Satisfaction (2016–2020) dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abrambeyer/us-hospital-customer-satisfaction-20162020)**  
with supplementary manually generated columns.

### Relational Schema (Highlights)

- **Hospital_Details**: PatientID, FacilityID, Facility_Name, Phone_Number, Address, Street, City, State, Zipcode, HospitalOwnership, HospitalType  
- **Location**: LocationID, City, State, Zipcode, Address, Facility_Name  
- **Patient_Details**: PatientID, Patient_Type, Insurance_Type  
- **Survey_Details**: SurveyID, PatientID, HCAHPSMeasureID, HCAHPS_Question, HCAHPS_Answer, PatientSurveyStarRating, SurveyResponseRatePercent, NumberofCompletedSurveys  
- **Emergency_Services**: ServiceID, ServiceType, Availability, ResponseTime, Capacity  

### Entity Relationship Model

The ERD demonstrates key relationships:

- **HOSPITAL** connects to **SURVEY** via the `HAS` relationship  
- **SURVEY** links to **SURVEY_DATES** through `CONDUCTS`  
- **HOSPITAL_RATING** captures performance across multiple dimensions  
- **HOSPITAL** receives ratings through `CAN_RECEIVE`  
- **PATIENTS** participate in surveys via the `CORRESPONDS` relationship  

---

## 🧱 Data Warehouse Design

The data warehouse implements a **star schema** in PostgreSQL.

### ⭐ Fact Table: `Survey_Fact`

**Keys**  
- SurveyFactID (PK)  
- SurveyID, PatientID, LocationID, ServiceID, FacilityID (FKs)  

**Measures**  
- AvgPatientSurveyStarRating  
- AvgSurveyResponseRatePercent  
- TotalCompletedSurveys  

### 🔷 Dimension Tables

1. **Hospital_Dimension**  
   - FacilityID, Facility_Name, Phone_Number, Address, City, State, HospitalOwnership, HospitalType  

2. **Survey_Dimension**  
   - SurveyID, HCAHPSMeasureID, HCAHPS_Question, HCAHPS_Answer, PatientSurveyStarRating,  
     SurveyResponseRatePercent, NumberofCompletedSurveys, LocationID, FacilityID, PatientID, ServiceID  

3. **Location_Dimension**  
   - LocationID, City, County, State, Zipcode, Address, Facility_Name  

4. **Patient_Dimension**  
   - PatientID, Patient_Type, Insurance_Type  

5. **Emergency_Services_Dimension**  
   - ServiceID, ServiceType, Availability, ResponseTime, Capacity  

### 🔄 Slowly Changing Dimensions

**SCD Type 1** is implemented for:

- Facility_Name  
- HospitalType  
- HospitalOwnership  

Current values overwrite historical data to maintain the most up-to-date facility information.

---

## 🔁 ETL Process

ETL operations are implemented in **Talend Open Studio**, connecting to PostgreSQL via JDBC.

### Dimension Loading

Source tables undergo transformation and loading:

- `Hospital_Details` → `Hospital_Dimension`  
- `Location` → `Location_Dimension`  
- `Patient_Details` → `Patient_Dimension`  
- `Survey_Details` → `Survey_Dimension`  
- `Emergency_Services` → `Emergency_Services_Dimension`  

**Transformations Applied**:

- Text trimming and quote removal  
- Boolean conversion (e.g., `YES`/`NO` → 1/0)  
- NULL value handling  
- Data type standardization and conversions  

### Fact Table Population

- Dimension data is joined using **tMap** components  
- Loaded into `Survey_Fact`  
- Aggregate measures such as `TotalCompletedSurveys` and `AvgPatientSurveyStarRating` are calculated during the ETL process  

---

## 📊 OLAP Operations

The data warehouse supports standard OLAP operations:

1. **Roll-Up**  
   - Average survey rating aggregated by state, region, and facility  

2. **Drill-Across**  
   - Correlation of survey completion counts with rating averages  

3. **Slice**  
   - Identification of facilities with:
     - PatientSurveyStarRating < 3  
     - SurveyResponseRatePercent < 50%  

4. **Roll-Up**  
   - Aggregation of emergency service availability and capacity by geographic region  

5. **Drill-Down**  
   - Temporal analysis of survey trends by quarter or year  

6. **Roll-Up**  
   - Aggregation of survey volume by city and hospital type
